Extracting Demographic and Diagnostic Data from NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to correctly select the pertinent RNA-Seq samples from TCGA project, it's necessary to access data about the samples from the NCI's Genomic Data Commons (GDC), where the data are now warehoused (<https://gdc.cancer.gov>).

An Bioconductor package named 'GenomicDataCommons' is utilized here in order to explore and then extract the relevant fields of sample attributes. The 'BiocManager' package must first be installed in order to install bioconductor packages.

``` r
# BiocManager::install('GenomicDataCommons')     # already installed on my machine
suppressMessages(require(GenomicDataCommons))
```

    ## Warning: no function found corresponding to methods exports from 'XVector'
    ## for: 'concatenateObjects'

    ## Warning: replacing previous import 'BiocGenerics::dims' by 'Biobase::dims'
    ## when loading 'SummarizedExperiment'

    ## Warning: replacing previous import 'Biobase::dims' by 'DelayedArray::dims'
    ## when loading 'SummarizedExperiment'

``` r
suppressMessages(require(dplyr))
suppressMessages(require(knitr))
```

Understanding TCGA Identifiers
------------------------------

Each RNA-Seq file that was generated by TCGA, whether it was obtained directly through GDC or from the Wang publication of cross-study normalized data, is identified through its TCGA identifier.

While other fields in the TCGA identifier may be important, the "TSS", "Participant", and "Sample" fields are sufficient for identifying the desired samples.

#### Exploring GDC Sample Attributes
